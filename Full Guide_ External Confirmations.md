## Full Guide: External Confirmations

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **External Confirmations** as an audit evidence-gathering technique, integrating the requirements of Sri Lanka Auditing Standard SLAuS 505, the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and best audit practices.

---

### **1. Introduction to External Confirmations

External confirmations are a key audit procedure for obtaining relevant and reliable audit evidence directly from independent third parties. They are especially important for verifying account balances and other information where evidence from the entity itself may not be sufficient or may be subject to bias[audit-book-2.txt, p.10][^4].

---

### **2. Objective and Scope (SLAuS 505)

**Objective:**
To design and perform external confirmation procedures that obtain relevant and reliable audit evidence, supporting the auditor’s opinion on the financial statements[^4].

---

### **3. Key Definitions (SLAuS 505)

- **External Confirmation:** Audit evidence obtained as a direct written response to the auditor from a third party (the confirming party), in paper, electronic, or other medium.
- **Positive Confirmation Request:** A request that the confirming party respond directly to the auditor, indicating agreement or disagreement with the information, or providing the requested information.
- **Negative Confirmation Request:** A request that the confirming party respond only if they disagree with the information provided.
- **Non-response:** Failure of the confirming party to respond, or to fully respond, to a positive confirmation request.
- **Exception:** A response indicating a difference between the information requested and the entity’s records[^4].

---

### **4. When to Use External Confirmations

- When audit evidence from the entity alone is insufficient or less reliable.
- For verifying existence, rights and obligations, and accuracy of balances such as cash, accounts receivable, payables, investments, and bank loans.
- When required by auditing standards or when there is heightened risk of fraud or error.

---

### **5. Designing External Confirmation Procedures

#### **A. Assessing the Appropriateness**

- Consider the objective of the confirmation (e.g., existence, accuracy, completeness).
- Evaluate the reliability of the confirming party and their ability to respond.
- Assess the risk of material misstatement and the nature of the item being confirmed.


#### **B. Factors Affecting Reliability**

- Prior experience with the confirming party.
- The method of communication (paper, electronic, secure portal).
- Whether management authorizes or encourages the response—some third parties may only respond with such authorization.
- The ability of the confirming party to provide the requested information (e.g., individual invoice vs. total balance)[^4].

---

### **6. Types of Confirmation Requests

| Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Positive Confirmation | Request a reply in all cases, whether the information is agreed or disagreed, or to provide info. |
| Negative Confirmation | Request a reply only if the information is disagreed with. |
| Blank Confirmation | Do not state the amount; ask the confirming party to fill in the amount or information. |

- **Positive confirmations** provide more reliable evidence but may have lower response rates.
- **Blank confirmations** can reduce the risk of careless responses but may further reduce response rates[^4].

---

### **7. Performing External Confirmation Procedures

- **Send requests directly to the third party** (not through management).
- **Maintain control over the process**: Prepare, send, and receive confirmations directly to ensure integrity.
- **Follow up on non-responses**: Consider alternative procedures if responses are not received or are incomplete.
- **Investigate exceptions**: Any differences between the confirmation and the entity’s records must be resolved.

---

### **8. Evaluating Results

- **Non-responses:** Assess the impact on audit evidence. If non-responses are significant, perform alternative procedures (e.g., subsequent cash receipts testing for receivables).
- **Exceptions:** Investigate and resolve all exceptions. Determine whether they indicate a misstatement or a deficiency in internal controls.
- **Reliability:** Consider whether the responses are reliable—responses from authorized, knowledgeable parties are more persuasive.

---

### **9. Limitations and Challenges

- **Non-responses** can limit the sufficiency of audit evidence.
- **Management interference** may compromise the reliability of confirmations.
- **Electronic confirmations** require secure, tamper-proof systems to maintain integrity.
- **Some information may not be confirmable** (e.g., contingent liabilities, unless disclosed by the third party).

---

### **10. Documentation

- Document the rationale for using confirmations, the process followed, the responses received, and how exceptions or non-responses were addressed.
- Retain copies of all confirmation requests, responses, and follow-up correspondence.

---

### **11. Practical Examples

- **Bank Confirmations:** Confirm cash balances, loans, and contingent liabilities directly with banks.
- **Receivables Confirmations:** Confirm balances or specific invoices with customers.
- **Payables Confirmations:** Confirm amounts owed with suppliers, especially for significant or unusual balances.
- **Legal Confirmations:** Confirm details of litigation and claims with external legal counsel.

---

### **12. Use of Technology

- **Electronic Confirmations:** Increasingly used for efficiency and speed but must ensure security and authenticity.
- **Audit Automation:** Some audit software can track, send, and manage confirmation requests and responses.

---

### **13. Summary and Key Points

- External confirmations are a powerful tool for obtaining independent, reliable audit evidence.
- The auditor is responsible for the entire confirmation process and must maintain control and integrity throughout.
- Non-responses and exceptions must be addressed through alternative procedures or further investigation.
- Proper documentation is essential for audit quality and compliance with standards.

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - SLAuS 505 sets out requirements for designing and performing external confirmations.
> - The auditor must ensure confirmations are relevant, reliable, and obtained directly from third parties.
> - Non-responses and exceptions require careful evaluation and alternative procedures as needed[^4][audit-book-2.txt, p.10].
