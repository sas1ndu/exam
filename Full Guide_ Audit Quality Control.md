## Full Guide: Audit Quality Control

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **Audit Quality Control**, integrating all key concepts, Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS 220), Sri Lanka Standard on Quality Control (SLSQC 1), and best practices as required by the CA Sri Lanka curriculum and study text.

### **1. Introduction to Audit Quality Control

Audit quality control refers to the policies, procedures, and frameworks established by audit firms and engagement teams to ensure that audits are performed consistently, ethically, and in accordance with professional standards and regulatory requirements. High-quality audits are essential for maintaining public trust, protecting stakeholders, and upholding the reputation of the profession[audit-book-2.txt, p.551][^6].

### **2. Framework for Audit Quality

#### **A. Definition and Purpose**

- The framework for audit quality sets out the elements necessary to achieve consistent, high-quality audits.
- It aims to enhance the reliability of audit opinions and the credibility of financial reporting.


#### **B. Elements of Audit Quality**

1. **Leadership Responsibilities for Quality**: Senior management and engagement partners must promote a culture of quality and ethical behavior.
2. **Relevant Ethical Requirements**: Compliance with independence, integrity, objectivity, and other ethical principles.
3. **Acceptance and Continuance of Client Relationships and Engagements**: Assessing client integrity, risks, and the firm’s ability to perform the engagement with competence.
4. **Human Resources**: Ensuring staff have the appropriate competence, capabilities, and commitment to ethical principles.
5. **Engagement Performance**: Proper planning, supervision, review, and consultation throughout the audit process.
6. **Monitoring**: Ongoing evaluation of the quality control system, including internal inspections and corrective actions[^7][^3][^6].
7. **Documentation**: Sufficient records of policies, procedures, and audit work to demonstrate compliance and support conclusions.

### **3. System of Quality Controls (Firm Level) — SLSQC 1

#### **A. Scope**

- SLSQC 1 applies to all firms performing audits, reviews, and other assurance and related services engagements.
- The system must be tailored to the size, structure, and nature of the firm[^7].


#### **B. Components**

1. **Leadership Responsibilities**: Setting the tone at the top and promoting a quality-oriented culture.
2. **Ethical Requirements**: Policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Code of Ethics, especially independence.
3. **Acceptance and Continuance**: Criteria for accepting new clients and engagements, including risk assessments.
4. **Human Resources**: Recruitment, development, assignment, and evaluation processes to ensure staff competence.
5. **Engagement Performance**: Policies for direction, supervision, review, and consultation on difficult or contentious matters.
6. **Monitoring**: Regular internal reviews, external inspections, and mechanisms for addressing deficiencies[^7].

#### **C. Implementation**

- The nature and extent of policies depend on firm size, complexity, and whether it is part of a network.
- Firms must document their quality control policies and monitor compliance.

### **4. Engagement Level Quality Control — SLAuS 220

#### **A. Responsibilities of the Engagement Partner**

- The engagement partner is responsible for the overall quality of each audit engagement.
- Key duties include:
    - Ensuring compliance with professional standards and legal/regulatory requirements.
    - Directing, supervising, and reviewing audit work.
    - Addressing significant matters and consulting as needed.
    - Ensuring sufficient, appropriate documentation is maintained[^3][^6].


#### **B. Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR)**

- For audits of listed entities and other high-risk engagements, an EQCR is required.
- The review must be performed by a partner or senior staff member not involved in the engagement.
- The EQCR covers significant judgments, conclusions, and audit reports before issuance[^3].

---

### **5. Practical Implementation and Monitoring

#### **A. Policies and Procedures**

- Firms must establish written policies and procedures for all elements of quality control.
- These should be communicated to all staff and embedded in daily practice.


#### **B. Monitoring and Remediation**

- Ongoing monitoring through internal inspections, peer reviews, and external regulatory reviews.
- Deficiencies must be addressed promptly, and corrective actions documented.


#### **C. Documentation**

- All quality control activities, including decisions, consultations, reviews, and monitoring results, must be documented and retained for inspection[^7][^3].

---

### **6. Challenges and Current Developments

- **Digitalization:** Automation and digital tools are transforming quality control processes, requiring new skills and controls.
- **Resource Constraints:** Smaller firms may face challenges in implementing robust quality systems, but must still comply with standards.
- **Global Networks:** Firms in international networks must ensure consistency across jurisdictions while complying with local regulations.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Quality control is an ongoing process, not a one-time exercise; regular updates and training are essential[^6][^7].

---

### **7. Summary and Key Points

- Audit quality control is vital for reliable, ethical, and consistent audits.
- The framework includes leadership, ethics, client acceptance, human resources, engagement performance, monitoring, and documentation.
- SLSQC 1 governs firm-level systems; SLAuS 220 governs engagement-level controls.
- Engagement partners are ultimately responsible for audit quality on each engagement.
- Continuous monitoring, documentation, and improvement are essential for audit quality and compliance.
