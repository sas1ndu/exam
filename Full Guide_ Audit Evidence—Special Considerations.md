## Full Guide: Audit Evidence—Special Considerations

This guide provides a detailed overview of special considerations in obtaining audit evidence, integrating relevant Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS), CA Sri Lanka curriculum content, and practical guidance from the study text.

---

### 1. Introduction

While general principles of audit evidence apply broadly, certain areas require special considerations due to their complexity, risk, or nature. These include:

- Inventory (existence and condition)
- Litigation and claims (completeness and disclosure)
- Segment information (presentation and disclosure)
- Opening balances and corresponding figures
- Related party transactions
- Accounting estimates and fair value measurements
- Subsequent events
- Use of experts and internal auditors
- Audits involving service organizations

Specialized SLAuSs provide guidance to auditors on how to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in these areas, ensuring audit quality and compliance[audit-book-2.txt, p.9; SLAuS 501][^3][^4][^5].

---

### 2. Inventory (SLAuS 501)

- **Objective:** Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the existence and condition of inventory.
- **Key Procedures:**
    - Attend physical inventory counts to observe counting procedures, inspect inventory, and perform test counts.
    - Evaluate management’s instructions and controls over inventory counting.
    - If counting is at a date other than the financial statement date, perform procedures to verify changes in inventory between the count date and year-end.
    - If attendance is impracticable, perform alternative procedures or modify the audit opinion if evidence is insufficient.
    - For inventory held by third parties, obtain confirmations or perform inspections.
- **Documentation:** Record observations, discrepancies, and reconciliation of inventory records[audit-book-2.txt, p.9; SLAuS 501][^4][^7].

---

### 3. Litigation and Claims (SLAuS 501)

- **Objective:** Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about the completeness of litigation and claims that may give rise to material misstatement.
- **Key Procedures:**
    - Inquire of management, internal legal counsel, and review minutes of governance meetings.
    - Review correspondence with external legal counsel and legal expense accounts.
    - If risks are identified, send a letter of inquiry to external legal counsel requesting direct communication.
    - If permission to communicate is denied or responses are inadequate, perform alternative procedures or modify the audit opinion.
    - Obtain written representations from management confirming disclosure of all known or possible litigation and claims.
- **Considerations:** Litigation and claims may affect valuation and measurement; auditors should coordinate with experts where necessary[audit-book-2.txt, p.9; SLAuS 501][^4][^7].

---

### 4. Segment Information (SLAuS 501)

- **Objective:** Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the presentation and disclosure of segment information in accordance with applicable financial reporting frameworks.
- **Key Procedures:**
    - Understand management’s methods for identifying reportable segments.
    - Test the accuracy and completeness of segment data.
    - Perform analytical procedures to assess reasonableness.
- **Documentation:** Document understanding, procedures performed, and conclusions[audit-book-2.txt, p.9; SLAuS 501][^7].

---

### 5. Other Special Considerations

- **Opening Balances (SLAuS 510):** Verify opening balances in initial audits or when prior period figures are used.
- **Related Party Transactions (SLAuS 550):** Identify, assess, and obtain evidence about related party transactions and disclosures.
- **Accounting Estimates (SLAuS 540):** Evaluate management’s assumptions and methods for estimates and fair values.
- **Subsequent Events (SLAuS 560):** Perform procedures to identify events occurring after the financial statement date that may require adjustment or disclosure.
- **Use of Experts (SLAuS 620):** Evaluate competence and work of experts used by management or the auditor.
- **Internal Audit (SLAuS 610):** Assess the appropriateness of using internal audit work.
- **Service Organizations (SLAuS 402):** Consider controls at service organizations that affect the entity’s financial reporting.

---

### 6. Evaluating Sufficiency and Appropriateness of Audit Evidence

- Evidence from external sources (e.g., confirmations, legal counsel) is generally more reliable than from internal sources.
- The nature and extent of procedures depend on assessed risks and materiality.
- Where evidence is limited or unavailable, auditors must consider the impact on the audit opinion and communicate with those charged with governance.

---

### 7. Impact on Audit Reporting

- Insufficient evidence or unresolved issues in special areas may lead to modified audit opinions (qualified, adverse, or disclaimer).
- Emphasis of matter or other matter paragraphs may be included to highlight significant disclosures or uncertainties (e.g., major litigation, inventory loss).
- Key audit matters (KAMs) may include significant risks or complex areas such as valuation of forward contracts or accounting estimates.

---

### 8. Summary and Key Points

- Special considerations in audit evidence gathering address areas prone to higher risk or complexity.
- SLAuS 501 provides detailed guidance on inventory, litigation, and segment information.
- Auditors must tailor procedures to the nature of the item and risk assessment.
- Effective communication, documentation, and professional judgment are essential.
- Emerging digital tools and data analytics enhance evidence gathering but do not replace professional skepticism.
