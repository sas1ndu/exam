## Full Guide: Assurance and Related Services

This guide comprehensively covers **Assurance and Related Services**, integrating the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, Sri Lanka Standards on Assurance Engagements (SLSAEs), and practical guidance from the study text and authoritative standards.

---

### **1. Introduction to Assurance and Related Services**

**Assurance services** are independent professional services that improve the quality of information for decision-makers. While the audit of financial statements is the most recognized assurance engagement, the profession provides a broader range of assurance and related services, including reviews, agreed-upon procedures, and compilations[audit-book-2.txt, p.495][^6][^5].

### **2. The Assurance Framework**

#### **A. Definition and Elements**

The **Sri Lanka Framework for Assurance Engagements** defines an assurance engagement as one in which a practitioner expresses a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users about the outcome of the evaluation or measurement of a subject matter against criteria.

**Key elements of an assurance engagement**:

- **Three-party relationship**: Practitioner (CA), responsible party (prepares subject matter), and intended users.
- **Appropriate subject matter**: Can be financial or non-financial (e.g., sustainability, controls).
- **Suitable criteria**: Standards or benchmarks against which the subject matter is evaluated.
- **Sufficient appropriate evidence**: Practitioner gathers evidence to support the conclusion.
- **Written report**: Communicates the conclusion to users[audit-book-2.txt, p.495][^5].


#### **B. Types of Assurance Engagements**

- **Reasonable Assurance Engagements**: Reduce engagement risk to an acceptably low level, allowing a positive form of conclusion (e.g., audits).
- **Limited Assurance Engagements**: Reduce risk to a level that is acceptable but higher than for reasonable assurance, resulting in a negative form of conclusion (e.g., reviews)[^5].

### **3. Types of Assurance and Related Services**

| Service Type | Description | Standard |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Audit** | Highest level of assurance, positive opinion on historical financial statements. | SLAuS |
| **Review** | Moderate (limited) assurance, negative conclusion on historical financial statements. | SLSRE 2400/2410 |
| **Other Assurance Engagements** | Reasonable or limited assurance on subject matters other than historical financial info. | SLSAE 3000 |
| **Agreed-Upon Procedures** | Factual findings on specific procedures; no assurance, just reporting results. | SLSRS 4400 |
| **Compilation** | Assembling information without providing assurance. | SLSRS 4410 |

### **4. Assurance Engagements in Practice**

#### **A. SLSAE 3000: Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews**

- Applies to a wide range of engagements, such as assurance on internal controls, sustainability reports, or regulatory compliance.
- Practitioner must comply with ethical requirements, ensure quality control, and plan/perform the engagement to gather sufficient evidence.
- The report must clearly state the level of assurance and the criteria used[^5].


#### **B. SLSAE 3402: Assurance Reports on Controls at a Service Organization**

- Relevant when a service organization’s controls impact user entities’ financial reporting.
- Service auditor provides a report for user entities and their auditors, supporting reliance on controls at the service organization[^4].
- The engagement involves:
    - Understanding and documenting the system.
    - Testing the design and, if required, the operating effectiveness of controls.
    - Reporting findings in a structured assurance report.


#### **C. Review Engagements (SLSRE 2400/2410)**

- Provide limited assurance (negative conclusion) on financial statements.
- Procedures are primarily inquiry and analytical review, less extensive than an audit.
- Used for interim financial information or when a full audit is not required[audit-book-2.txt, p.495].


#### **D. Agreed-Upon Procedures (SLSRS 4400)**

- Practitioner performs procedures agreed with the client and reports factual findings.
- No assurance is provided; users draw their own conclusions.
- Common for compliance checks, grant audits, or specific account verifications[^5].


#### **E. Compilation Engagements (SLSRS 4410)**

- Practitioner compiles financial information based on data provided by management.
- No assurance is expressed; the report states that no audit or review was performed[^5].

### **5. Reporting in Assurance and Related Services**

#### **A. Key Elements of Assurance Reports**

- **Title**: Identifies the report as an assurance report.
- **Addressee**: Specifies the intended users.
- **Subject Matter and Criteria**: Clearly described.
- **Responsibilities**: Of the responsible party and practitioner.
- **Summary of Work Performed**: Nature, timing, and extent.
- **Conclusion**: Positive (reasonable assurance) or negative (limited assurance).
- **Date and Signature**: Indicates completion and practitioner’s accountability[audit-book-2.txt, p.495][^5].


#### **B. Examples of Report Conclusions**

- **Reasonable assurance**:
“In our opinion, the controls at XYZ Service Organization were suitably designed and operated effectively throughout the period…”
- **Limited assurance**:
“Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with…”
- **Agreed-upon procedures**:
“We performed the procedures agreed with you and report the following factual findings…”
- **Compilation**:
“We have compiled the accompanying financial information based on information provided by management…”

---

### **6. Preconditions and Acceptance**

- Practitioner must ensure:
    - The subject matter is appropriate and can be evaluated against suitable criteria.
    - The engagement has a rational purpose and intended users are identifiable.
    - The responsible party acknowledges and accepts responsibility for the subject matter[^5].

---

### **7. Ethical and Quality Control Requirements**

- Practitioners must comply with the CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics (independence, objectivity, confidentiality).
- Quality control procedures must be applied at the engagement level (SLSQC 1)[^5].

---

### **8. Documentation and Communication**

- All significant matters, evidence obtained, and conclusions must be documented.
- The practitioner should communicate with those charged with governance about the engagement scope, findings, and any significant issues[^5].

---

### **9. Summary and Key Points**

- Assurance and related services go beyond statutory audits to meet diverse user needs.
- The assurance framework requires clear subject matter, suitable criteria, sufficient evidence, and transparent reporting.
- SLSAE 3000 governs general assurance engagements; SLSAE 3402 covers controls at service organizations; SLSRE 2400/2410, SLSRS 4400, and SLSRS 4410 address reviews, agreed-upon procedures, and compilations, respectively.
- Ethical compliance and quality control are fundamental to all engagements.
- The form and content of reports vary by engagement type but must always be clear, complete, and tailored to user needs.
