## Full Guide: Audit Planning and Risk Assessment

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **Audit Planning and Risk Assessment**, synthesizing all key concepts, standards, and practical applications as outlined in the CA Sri Lanka curriculum and the provided study text.

---

### **1. Introduction**

Audit planning and risk assessment are foundational to the audit process. Proper planning ensures that the audit is conducted efficiently and effectively, while risk assessment enables auditors to focus on areas where material misstatements are most likely to occur. This approach is essential for achieving audit objectives and providing reasonable assurance on financial statements[audit-book-2.txt, p.8].

---

### **2. Key Learning Outcomes**

- **Explain preconditions for an audit** (SLAuS 210)
- **Demonstrate the importance of overall audit strategy** (SLAuS 300, 315, 240, 600)
- **Assess risk of material misstatement, including fraud risks** (SLAuS 315)
- **Apply materiality in planning and performing the audit**
- **Outline responses and further procedures for identified risks** (SLAuS 330)
- **Apply risk assessment to complex issues** (SLAuS 540, 550, 570)
- **Demonstrate the use of experts and reliance on others** (SLAuS 610, 620, 402)
- **Explain compliance with laws and regulations** (SLAuS 250)[audit-book-2.txt, p.8-9].

---

### **3. Preconditions for an Audit**

Before accepting an audit engagement, auditors must ensure:

- **Management’s acceptance of responsibility** for preparing financial statements, maintaining internal controls, and providing access to all relevant information.
- **Agreement on the terms of engagement**, usually documented in an engagement letter, in line with SLAuS 210[audit-book-2.txt, p.8].

---

### **4. Overall Audit Strategy and Planning**

#### **A. Importance of Audit Planning**

- Establishes the scope, timing, and direction of the audit.
- Ensures resources are allocated to high-risk areas.
- Enhances audit efficiency and effectiveness.


#### **B. Developing the Audit Plan**

- **Nature, timing, and extent of risk assessment procedures**
- **Planned responses to identified risks**
- **Other planned audit procedures and resources**[^3][^7][audit-book-2.txt, p.8].


#### **C. Overall Audit Strategy**

- Sets the framework for the audit plan.
- Considers entity characteristics, reporting objectives, significant factors, and preliminary engagement activities.

---

### **5. Risk Assessment**

#### **A. Understanding the Entity and Its Environment**

- Obtain an understanding of the entity, its environment, and internal controls (SLAuS 315).
- Identify business risks that may result in material misstatement.


#### **B. Types of Risks**

- **Inherent Risk:** Susceptibility of an assertion to misstatement, assuming no controls.
- **Control Risk:** Risk that a misstatement will not be prevented or detected by internal controls.
- **Detection Risk:** Risk that audit procedures will not detect a misstatement.


#### **C. Risk of Material Misstatement**

- Assess risks at both the financial statement and assertion levels.
- Consider fraud risks (SLAuS 240) and significant risks requiring special audit consideration[audit-book-2.txt, p.8-9][^5][^6].


#### **D. Risk Assessment Procedures**

- **Inquiry** of management and others
- **Analytical procedures**
- **Observation and inspection**
- **Discussion among engagement team**

---

### **6. Materiality**

- **Definition:** The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that could influence users’ economic decisions.
- **Application:** Used in planning the audit, performing procedures, and evaluating misstatements.
- **Materiality is not a fixed amount:** It is based on professional judgment and may be revised as the audit progresses[audit-book-2.txt, p.8-9][^5].

---

### **7. Responding to Assessed Risks**

#### **A. Overall Responses**

- Assign more experienced staff to high-risk areas.
- Increase supervision and professional skepticism.
- Modify the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.


#### **B. Further Audit Procedures**

- **Tests of controls:** To assess operating effectiveness of controls.
- **Substantive procedures:** To detect material misstatements at the assertion level.
- **Dual-purpose tests:** Combine tests of controls and substantive procedures.


#### **C. Addressing Risks at Assertion Level**

- Tailor procedures to specific risks identified for each assertion (existence, completeness, accuracy, etc.)[audit-book-2.txt, p.8-9][^5][^6].

---

### **8. Complex Issues in Risk Assessment**

#### **A. Related Party Transactions (SLAuS 550)**

- Identify and assess risks associated with related parties.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate evidence regarding disclosures and the substance of transactions.


#### **B. Going Concern (SLAuS 570)**

- Evaluate management’s assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
- Consider events or conditions that may cast significant doubt.


#### **C. Accounting Estimates (SLAuS 540)**

- Assess the risk of material misstatement in estimates, including fair value measurements.
- Evaluate management’s methods, data, and assumptions[audit-book-2.txt, p.9].

---

### **9. Using the Work of Others**

- **Experts:** Use of management’s or auditor’s experts for areas requiring specialized knowledge (SLAuS 620).
- **Internal Auditors:** Assess the objectivity and competence of internal auditors before relying on their work (SLAuS 610).
- **Service Organizations:** Evaluate controls at service organizations relevant to the audit (SLAuS 402)[audit-book-2.txt, p.9].

---

### **10. Compliance with Laws and Regulations**

- Understand the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the entity.
- Design procedures to identify non-compliance.
- Report identified or suspected non-compliance to those charged with governance and, where required, to regulators (SLAuS 250)[audit-book-2.txt, p.9].

---

### **11. Documentation and Communication**

- Document the overall audit strategy, audit plan, risk assessments, and responses.
- Communicate significant risks, planned responses, and deficiencies in internal control to those charged with governance.

---

### **12. Practical Application and Digital Environment**

- **Audit Automation:** Use of data analytics and computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs) to enhance risk assessment and evidence gathering.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Digital tools enable real-time risk assessment and more dynamic audit planning[audit-book-2.txt, p.21-37].

---

### **13. Summary and Key Points**

- Audit planning and risk assessment are critical to audit quality and effectiveness.
- Understanding the entity, assessing risks, and applying materiality guide the audit approach.
- Responses must be tailored to identified risks, including complex issues like related parties, going concern, and estimates.
- Use of experts and reliance on the work of others must follow professional standards.
- Compliance with laws and regulations is integral to the audit process.
- Documentation and communication are essential for transparency and accountability.
