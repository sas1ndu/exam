## Full Guide: Audit Sampling and Analytical Procedures

This guide integrates all key concepts, standards, and practical applications for **Audit Sampling and Analytical Procedures**, drawing from Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS 520 \& 530), the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and authoritative sources.

---

### **1. Introduction**

Audit sampling and analytical procedures are critical techniques for gathering sufficient appropriate audit evidence. Sampling allows auditors to draw conclusions about large populations by testing a subset, while analytical procedures enable auditors to identify unusual trends, relationships, or fluctuations that may indicate risks or misstatements[audit-book-2.txt, p.10][^3][^6].

---

### **2. Audit Sampling (SLAuS 530)**

#### **A. Definition and Purpose**

- **Audit sampling** is the application of audit procedures to less than 100% of items in a population, enabling the auditor to form a conclusion about the entire population[^3][^8].
- Used in tests of controls and substantive procedures (tests of details).


#### **B. Types of Sampling**

- **Statistical Sampling:** Uses random selection and probability theory to evaluate results.
- **Non-Statistical Sampling:** Relies on auditor judgment rather than formal statistical methods.


#### **C. Sampling Risk**

- The risk that the auditor’s conclusion based on a sample may differ from the conclusion if the entire population were tested[^3].
    - **Type I Error:** Concluding controls are less effective than they are.
    - **Type II Error:** Concluding controls are more effective than they are (more critical for audit effectiveness).


#### **D. Steps in Audit Sampling**

1. **Define the Objective:** What assertion or control is being tested?
2. **Define the Population:** The entire set of data relevant to the objective.
3. **Determine Sample Size:** Influenced by risk, tolerable misstatement, expected deviation, and population variability[^3][^8].
4. **Select Sampling Method:**
    - Random, systematic, stratified, or haphazard selection.
5. **Perform Audit Procedures:** Apply procedures to each selected item.
6. **Evaluate Deviations or Misstatements:** Investigate the nature and cause.
7. **Project Results:** Extrapolate sample findings to the population.
8. **Conclude and Document:** Assess if the evidence is sufficient and appropriate, and document all steps and findings[^3][^8].

#### **E. Factors Influencing Sample Size**

- Risk of material misstatement
- Population size and variability
- Tolerable error (misstatement)
- Expected error rate[^3][^8]


#### **F. Projecting and Evaluating Results**

- Project identified misstatements to the population.
- Consider whether further audit procedures are needed if misstatements or deviations are found[^3][^8].

### **3. Analytical Procedures (SLAuS 520)**

#### **A. Definition and Purpose**

- **Analytical procedures** involve evaluating financial information by studying plausible relationships among financial and non-financial data[^4][^5][^6].
- Used to identify risks, obtain audit evidence, and form an overall conclusion.


#### **B. Stages of Use**

1. **Risk Assessment:** At the start, to understand the entity and identify risk areas.
2. **Substantive Analytical Procedures:** During fieldwork, as substantive tests to obtain evidence about assertions.
3. **Final Analytical Procedures:** At the end, as an overall review to ensure consistency with the auditor’s understanding[^4][^6].

#### **C. Types of Analytical Procedures**

- Comparisons with prior periods, budgets, forecasts, or industry data.
- Ratio analysis (e.g., gross profit margin, current ratio).
- Reasonableness tests (e.g., expected depreciation).
- Relationships between financial and non-financial data (e.g., payroll costs to number of employees)[^5][^6].


#### **D. Requirements for Substantive Analytical Procedures**

- **Suitability:** Assess if analytical procedures are appropriate for the assertion.
- **Reliability of Data:** Evaluate the source, comparability, and controls over data preparation.
- **Expectation Development:** Develop precise expectations of recorded amounts or ratios.
- **Threshold for Investigation:** Set an acceptable difference before further investigation is required[^6][^5].


#### **E. Investigating Differences**

- If significant or unexpected differences are found, auditors must:
    - Inquire of management.
    - Obtain corroborative evidence through other procedures[^6][^5].


#### **F. Documentation**

- Document the analytical procedures performed, expectations, results, and conclusions[^6][^5].

### **4. Use of Technology and Data Analytics**

- **Data Analytics:** Enables testing of 100% of transactions, identification of anomalies, and more precise risk assessment. It can supplement or, in some cases, replace traditional sampling and analytical procedures[audit-book-2.txt, p.24-26].
- **CAATs (Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques):** Include audit software for sampling, extraction, and analysis, and test data for control testing[audit-book-2.txt, p.28-31].

---

### **5. Practical Examples**

#### **A. Audit Sampling**

- Selecting a sample of receivables for confirmation.
- Testing a subset of inventory items for existence and valuation.


#### **B. Analytical Procedures**

- Comparing current year sales to prior years and investigating significant fluctuations.
- Analyzing payroll expense trends relative to headcount changes.
- Comparing gross margin ratios to industry averages[^5][^6].

---

### **6. Limitations and Challenges**

- Sampling risk and non-sampling risk (e.g., inappropriate procedure selection).
- Reliability of data for analytical procedures.
- Over-reliance on technology without adequate professional judgment[audit-book-2.txt, p.26].

---

### **7. Summary and Key Points**

- **Audit sampling** allows auditors to draw conclusions about populations efficiently and effectively, but requires careful planning and evaluation[^3][^8].
- **Analytical procedures** are versatile, used at multiple audit stages, and can provide powerful evidence when applied correctly[^4][^6].
- Technology and data analytics are transforming both sampling and analytical procedures, enabling broader and deeper audit coverage[audit-book-2.txt, p.24-26].
- Both techniques require documentation, professional judgment, and skepticism to ensure audit quality.

---

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - Audit sampling and analytical procedures are foundational to modern audit evidence gathering.
> - Proper design, execution, and evaluation are essential for reliable conclusions.
> - Advances in audit technology are enhancing the effectiveness of these procedures, but professional judgment remains paramount.
