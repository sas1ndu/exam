## Full Guide: Gathering Audit Evidence—Test of Details

This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of the **Test of Details** as a substantive audit procedure, integrating the requirements of Sri Lanka Auditing Standards, CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and best audit practices.

---

### **1. Introduction to Audit Evidence and Test of Details**

Audit evidence is all the information used by the auditor to arrive at conclusions on which the audit opinion is based. It includes information from accounting records and other sources, and must be both sufficient (quantity) and appropriate (quality, i.e., relevance and reliability)[^3][^8]. The **Test of Details** is a primary substantive procedure, focusing on verifying the accuracy, completeness, and validity of individual transactions, account balances, and disclosures in the financial statements[^4][^5][^6].

---

### **2. Financial Statement Assertions**

Tests of details are designed to address specific **management assertions** about financial statements, including[^3][^7]:

- **Occurrence/Existence:** Transactions and balances exist and have occurred.
- **Completeness:** All transactions and balances that should be recorded are included.
- **Accuracy/Valuation:** Amounts and data are recorded appropriately and at correct values.
- **Cutoff:** Transactions are recorded in the correct accounting period.
- **Classification:** Items are recorded in the proper accounts.
- **Rights and Obligations:** The entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are obligations of the entity.
- **Presentation and Disclosure:** Information is appropriately presented and disclosed.

Auditors design tests of details to gather evidence supporting or refuting these assertions for key account balances and classes of transactions[^3][^7][^5].

---

### **3. Nature and Purpose of Test of Details**

- **Definition:** Test of details involves direct examination of supporting documentation and evidence for individual transactions, balances, or disclosures[^4][^5][^6].
- **Purpose:** To confirm the accuracy, completeness, and validity of financial information, and to detect material misstatements at the assertion level[^4][^5].
- **Role:** It is a core substantive procedure, often used alongside substantive analytical procedures, especially in areas with higher risk of material misstatement[^6][^5].

---

### **4. Procedures and Techniques**

#### **A. Common Test of Details Procedures**

- **Vouching:** Tracing entries from the accounting records to supporting documents (e.g., invoices, contracts) to confirm occurrence and accuracy.
- **Tracing:** Following transactions from source documents to the accounting records to test completeness.
- **Confirmation:** Obtaining direct verification from third parties (e.g., bank confirmations, receivables confirmations).
- **Inspection:** Examining physical assets or documents.
- **Recalculation:** Checking the mathematical accuracy of records.
- **Reperformance:** Independently executing procedures or controls originally performed as part of the entity’s internal controls.
- **Inquiry:** Seeking information from knowledgeable persons within or outside the entity.


#### **B. Sampling Methods**

Auditors often use sampling to select items for testing, ensuring the sample is representative of the population. Common methods include[^4]:

- **Random sampling**
- **Systematic sampling**
- **Stratified sampling**

The choice depends on audit objectives, assessed risk, and desired confidence level.

---

### **5. Designing Tests of Details**

- **Risk-Based Approach:** Tests are designed in response to assessed risks of material misstatement (SLAuS 330)[^9]. Higher risk areas require more extensive or persuasive evidence.
- **Selection of Items:** Auditors determine effective means of selecting items for testing, considering the purpose of the procedure and the population being tested[^8].
- **Sufficiency and Appropriateness:** The quantity of evidence (sufficiency) is influenced by the risk of misstatement and the quality of evidence (appropriateness)[^3][^8]. High-quality evidence can reduce the amount needed; poor quality requires more.

---

### **6. Examples of Test of Details**

- **Sales Transactions:** Select a sample of sales from the ledger, examine related invoices, delivery notes, and contracts, and match to recorded entries and receipts[^5].
- **Receivables:** Send confirmations to customers, trace subsequent receipts in bank statements, and inspect contracts or correspondence[^5].
- **Inventory:** Inspect physical inventory, trace items to inventory records, and verify valuation calculations.
- **Payables:** Confirm balances with suppliers, inspect invoices and payment records, and review subsequent payments.

---

### **7. Use of Technology and Data Analytics**

- **CAATs (Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques):** Audit software and test data are used to automate and expand tests of details, enabling auditors to test larger samples or even entire populations[1, audit-book-2.txt, p.28-30].
- **Data Analytics:** Advanced tools allow auditors to identify anomalies, trends, and outliers, and to perform more efficient and effective tests of details[1, audit-book-2.txt, p.24-25].

---

### **8. Addressing Inconsistencies and Limitations**

- If evidence from different sources is inconsistent or if reliability is doubtful, auditors must modify or expand procedures to resolve the matter and consider its effect on the audit[^8].
- Tests of details may not detect all misstatements, especially if documentation is falsified or collusion exists. Professional skepticism and corroborating evidence are essential.

---

### **9. Documentation**

Auditors must document:

- The nature, timing, and extent of tests of details performed.
- The rationale for sample selection and procedures.
- The results and conclusions drawn from the evidence obtained[^3][^8].

---

### **10. Summary and Key Points**

- **Tests of details** are substantive procedures aimed at verifying individual transactions, balances, and disclosures through direct examination of evidence.
- They are designed to address specific financial statement assertions and are tailored to assessed risks.
- The sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence are critical; high-risk areas require more or better evidence.
- Use of sampling, CAATs, and data analytics enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of tests of details.
- All procedures and findings must be thoroughly documented to support the audit opinion.
