## Full Guide: Gathering Audit Evidence—Substantive Procedures

This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of **Substantive Procedures** as a critical component of gathering audit evidence, integrating Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS), the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and best audit practices.

---

### **1. Introduction to Substantive Procedures

Substantive procedures are audit processes designed to detect material misstatements at the assertion level in classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures. They are a core part of the auditor's response to assessed risks and are essential for obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the audit opinion[audit-book-2.txt, p.10][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7].

---

### **2. Concept of Audit Evidence

Audit evidence includes all information used by the auditor to reach conclusions on which the audit opinion is based. It encompasses accounting records, documentation, third-party confirmations, and information obtained through inquiry, observation, and inspection[^3][^5].

- **Sufficiency**: Quantity of evidence (influenced by risk of misstatement and quality of evidence).
- **Appropriateness**: Quality of evidence (relevance and reliability)[^3][^5].

The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to draw reasonable conclusions[^3][^5].

---

### **3. Types of Substantive Procedures

Substantive procedures fall into two main categories[^6][^7]:


| Type | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Tests of Details** | Directly examine transactions, account balances, and disclosures (e.g., vouching, confirmations) |
| **Substantive Analytical Procedures** | Evaluate financial information through analysis of plausible relationships among data (e.g., ratio analysis, trend analysis) |

Both are used to address the risk of material misstatement at the assertion level[^6][^7].

---

### **4. Assertions Addressed by Substantive Procedures

Substantive procedures are designed to test management assertions, including:

- **Occurrence/Existence**: Transactions and balances exist.
- **Completeness**: All items that should be recorded are included.
- **Accuracy/Valuation**: Amounts are correct and properly valued.
- **Cutoff**: Transactions are recorded in the correct period.
- **Classification**: Items are in the correct accounts.
- **Rights and Obligations**: Entity owns assets and owes liabilities.
- **Presentation and Disclosure**: Items are properly presented and disclosed[^3][^5][^6].

---

### **5. Designing Substantive Procedures

#### **A. Risk-Based Approach**

- The nature, timing, and extent of substantive procedures are determined by the assessed risks of material misstatement at the assertion level[^4][^6][^7].
- Higher risk areas require more persuasive evidence and/or a greater extent of testing.


#### **B. Selection of Procedures**

- The auditor selects procedures based on the characteristics of the account or transaction, the effectiveness of controls, and the auditor’s professional judgment[^4][^6].

---

### **6. Examples of Substantive Procedures

#### **A. Tests of Details**

- **Vouching**: Tracing from the accounting records to supporting documents.
- **Tracing**: Following transactions from source documents to the records.
- **Confirmations**: Obtaining direct verification from third parties (e.g., banks, customers).
- **Inspection**: Examining physical assets or documents.
- **Recalculation**: Checking mathematical accuracy.
- **Reperformance**: Independently executing procedures or controls.


#### **B. Substantive Analytical Procedures**

- Comparing recorded amounts with auditor expectations based on independent data.
- Ratio analysis, trend analysis, and reasonableness tests.

---

### **7. Timing and Extent of Substantive Procedures

- **Interim vs. Year-End**: Substantive procedures may be performed at interim dates, but the auditor must perform further procedures or combine with tests of controls to cover the remaining period[^4][^7].
- **Extent**: The higher the risk, the greater the extent of procedures (i.e., larger sample sizes, more transactions tested)[^4][^7].

---

### **8. Use of Technology in Substantive Procedures

- **Data Analytics**: Enables testing of 100% of transactions, identification of anomalies, and more precise risk assessment[audit-book-2.txt, p.24-26].
- **CAATs (Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques)**: Audit software and test data can automate and enhance substantive testing, especially for large data sets[audit-book-2.txt, p.28-31].

---

### **9. Special Considerations

- **Complex Account Balances**: Substantive procedures must be tailored for estimates, fair values, related party transactions, and going concern issues[audit-book-2.txt, p.10].
- **Inventory, Litigation, and Segment Information**: Specific procedures are required for high-risk or complex areas (refer to SLAuS 501 for inventory and litigation)[audit-book-2.txt, p.10].
- **External Confirmation**: Used for items like receivables and bank balances to obtain reliable third-party evidence.

---

### **10. Evaluating and Documenting Evidence

- The auditor must evaluate whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained to reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level[^3][^4][^5].
- All substantive procedures, findings, and conclusions must be thoroughly documented[^4][^5][^6].

---

### **11. Summary and Key Points

- Substantive procedures are essential for detecting material misstatements and supporting the audit opinion.
- They include tests of details and substantive analytical procedures, designed based on risk assessment.
- The sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence are critical; high-risk areas require more or better evidence.
- Technology and data analytics are transforming the effectiveness and efficiency of substantive procedures.
- Special considerations apply for complex balances and high-risk areas; documentation is mandatory.

---

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - Substantive procedures are a cornerstone of audit evidence gathering.
> - Both tests of details and analytical procedures are used, depending on risk and assertion.
> - Advances in audit technology are enhancing substantive testing, but professional judgment remains essential.
