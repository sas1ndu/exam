## Full Guide: Gathering Audit Evidence—Inventory, Litigation, and Segment Information

This guide explains the auditor’s responsibilities and procedures for obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence related to **inventory**, **litigation and claims**, and **segment information**, based on Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS 501), the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and best practices.

---

### **1. Introduction**

Certain items in the financial statements—such as inventory, litigation and claims, and segment information—require specific audit attention due to their complexity, risk of material misstatement, and the nature of audit evidence required. SLAuS 501 sets out the auditor’s objectives and procedures for these areas[^3][^4][^5][^6].

---

### **2. Inventory**

#### **A. Objective**

- To obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the **existence** and **condition** of inventory[^3][^6].


#### **B. Key Audit Procedures**

1. **Attendance at Physical Inventory Counting**
    - **Required if inventory is material** to the financial statements, unless impracticable.
    - Auditor’s attendance enables:
        - Evaluation of management’s instructions and procedures for inventory count.
        - Observation of the count process.
        - Inspection of inventory items.
        - Performance of test counts[^3][^5][^6].
    - **Reconcile test counts** with inventory records to ensure accuracy[^4].
    - **Cut-off Procedures:** Verify transactions around the inventory count date to ensure proper recording[^4].
2. **Alternative Procedures**
    - If unable to attend the scheduled count (e.g., due to unforeseen circumstances), attend a count on an alternative date and perform audit procedures on intervening transactions[^3][^6].
    - If attendance is impracticable, perform alternative procedures (e.g., inspection, analytical procedures). If sufficient evidence cannot be obtained, modify the audit opinion[^3][^6].
3. **Inventory Held by Third Parties**
    - Obtain external confirmation from the third party regarding quantities and condition.
    - Perform inspection or other audit procedures as appropriate (e.g., review warehouse receipts)[^3][^5][^6].
4. **Multiple Locations**
    - Visit key locations for physical verification.
    - For locations not visited, rely on confirmations or appoint another auditor to observe counts[^4].
5. **Documentation**
    - Record procedures performed, evidence obtained, discrepancies, adjustments, and conclusions[^4].

#### **C. Analytical Procedures**

- Analyze inventory turnover ratios and compare with industry standards to identify anomalies[^4].

---

### **3. Litigation and Claims**

#### **A. Objective**

- To obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the **completeness** of litigation and claims involving the entity[^3][^4][^5][^6].


#### **B. Key Audit Procedures**

1. **Inquiry with Management and Legal Counsel**
    - Inquire of management and, where applicable, in-house legal counsel about known or potential litigation and claims.
    - Review minutes of meetings of those charged with governance[^4][^6].
2. **Review of Correspondence**
    - Examine correspondence with external legal advisors and regulatory authorities for indications of claims or disputes[^4][^6].
3. **Review of Legal Expense Accounts**
    - Analyze accounts to identify payments or accruals related to legal matters[^6].
4. **Assess Provisions and Disclosures**
    - Evaluate whether the entity has adequately accounted for and disclosed contingencies in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework (e.g., Ind AS 37/SLFRS)[^4].
5. **Direct Communication with Legal Advisors**
    - Where necessary, obtain direct confirmation from the entity’s external legal counsel regarding the status of litigation and claims[^3][^5].
6. **Documentation**
    - Document all procedures, evidence, and conclusions regarding litigation and claims[^4].

---

### **4. Segment Information**

#### **A. Objective**

- To obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the **presentation and disclosure** of segment information in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework[^3][^4][^5].


#### **B. Key Audit Procedures**

1. **Understanding Management’s Methods**
    - Obtain an understanding of the methods used by management to determine segment information[^3][^5].
    - Evaluate whether these methods are likely to result in disclosures that comply with the financial reporting framework (e.g., Ind AS 108/SLFRS 8)[^3][^4].
2. **Testing Application of Methods**
    - Where appropriate, test the application of these methods to ensure accuracy and completeness of segment data allocation[^3][^4].
3. **Analytical Procedures**
    - Perform analytical procedures or other audit procedures to assess the reasonableness of segment information[^3][^4].
4. **Documentation**
    - Record all procedures, evidence, and conclusions regarding segment information[^4].

---

### **5. Practical Challenges and Solutions**

- **Inventory at Multiple Locations:** Use a combination of physical attendance, confirmations, and analytical procedures to address completeness and accuracy[^4].
- **Incomplete Legal Disclosures:** Demonstrate a practical approach by inquiring widely, reviewing legal expenses, and seeking direct legal confirmations[^4].
- **Complex Segment Allocations:** Verify the accuracy of allocation methods and test for compliance with reporting standards[^4].

---

### **6. Reporting Implications**

- **Inability to Obtain Sufficient Evidence:** If the auditor cannot obtain sufficient appropriate evidence (e.g., cannot attend inventory count and no alternative procedures are possible), a qualified or disclaimer of opinion may be required[^3][^5].
- **Emphasis of Matter:** If there is a significant uncertainty (e.g., ongoing litigation), the auditor may include an emphasis of matter paragraph in the audit report to highlight the disclosure[^5].

---

### **7. Summary and Key Points**

- **Inventory:** Attend physical counts, perform test counts, reconcile records, use confirmations for third-party inventory, and document all findings.
- **Litigation and Claims:** Inquire, review correspondence, assess provisions and disclosures, and obtain direct confirmations when needed.
- **Segment Information:** Understand and test management’s methods, perform analytical procedures, and ensure compliance with reporting standards.
- **Documentation:** Keep thorough records of all procedures, evidence, and conclusions for each area.
- **Reporting:** Be prepared to modify the audit opinion or include emphasis of matter paragraphs if sufficient appropriate evidence cannot be obtained or significant uncertainties exist.
