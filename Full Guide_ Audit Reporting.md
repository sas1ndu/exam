## Full Guide: Audit Reporting

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **Audit Reporting**, integrating all key concepts, standards, and practical applications from the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS), and authoritative study materials.

### **1. Introduction to Audit Reporting

The auditor’s report is the formal means by which the external auditor expresses an opinion on the truth and fairness of an entity’s financial statements. It is addressed primarily to shareholders but also serves other stakeholders. The content and structure of the auditor’s report are prescribed by statute and professional standards, primarily SLAuS 700, 701, 705, 706, and related standards[audit-book-2.txt, p.43-44][^3][^4].

---

### **2. Objectives and Basis for Audit Opinion

- **Objective:**
    - To form an opinion on the financial statements based on conclusions drawn from audit evidence.
    - To clearly express that opinion through a written report[^4].
- **Forming an Opinion:**
    - The auditor must conclude whether reasonable assurance has been obtained that the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement.
    - Considerations include:
        - Sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence.
        - Materiality of uncorrected misstatements.
        - Adequacy of accounting policies and disclosures.
        - Consistency and appropriateness of accounting policies.
        - Reasonableness of accounting estimates.
        - Fair presentation and compliance with the applicable financial reporting framework[audit-book-2.txt, p.45].

### **3. Basic Elements of the Auditor’s Report (SLAuS 700)

The auditor’s report must be in writing and include the following elements in a consistent layout[audit-book-2.txt, p.47][^3]:


| Element | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Title | Clearly indicates it is the report of the independent auditor. |
| Addressee | Determined by law or regulation (usually shareholders or those charged with governance). |
| Opinion Section | Identifies the entity, states that the financial statements have been audited, and covers the relevant period. |
| Basis for Opinion | States the audit was conducted in accordance with SLAuSs, auditor’s independence, and sufficiency of evidence. |
| Going Concern | Separate section if a material uncertainty exists. |
| Key Audit Matters | For listed entities, describes matters of most significance (see below). |
| Other Information | Describes auditor’s responsibilities regarding other information in annual reports. |
| Management’s Responsibility | Details management’s responsibility for financial statements and internal control. |
| Auditor’s Responsibility | Explains auditor’s objectives, materiality, professional judgment, and responsibilities. |
| Other Reporting Responsibilities | Additional required reporting by law or regulation. |
| Auditor’s Address | Location of the auditor’s practice. |
| Date of Report | No earlier than the date sufficient evidence is obtained. |
| Engagement Partner ID | Required for PLCs in Sri Lanka. |

### **4. Types of Audit Opinions

#### **A. Unmodified (Unqualified) Opinion**

- Issued when the auditor concludes the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable framework[audit-book-2.txt, p.46].


#### **B. Modified Opinions (SLAuS 705)**

- Issued when:
    - The financial statements are materially misstated, or
    - The auditor cannot obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence[^4][^5].

| Type of Opinion | When Used |
| :-- | :-- |
| Qualified Opinion | Material misstatement or limitation, but not pervasive. |
| Adverse Opinion | Material and pervasive misstatement. |
| Disclaimer of Opinion | Inability to obtain sufficient evidence, with possible effects that are material and pervasive. |

**Pervasiveness** refers to whether the effects are confined or fundamental to the financial statements as a whole[audit-book-2.txt, p.61][^5].

### **5. Key Audit Matters (KAMs) (SLAuS 701)

- **Definition:** Matters that, in the auditor’s professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the current period.
- **Purpose:** Enhance transparency and communicative value for users.
- **Content:** For each KAM, the auditor describes:
    - Why the matter was significant.
    - How it was addressed in the audit.
    - Reference to related disclosures[audit-book-2.txt, p.52-54].
- **Applicability:** Mandatory for listed entities; may be included for others.

---

### **6. Emphasis of Matter and Other Matter Paragraphs (SLAuS 706)

- **Emphasis of Matter (EoM):** Draws attention to a matter appropriately disclosed in the financial statements that is fundamental to users’ understanding (e.g., major subsequent event, significant uncertainty). Does not modify the opinion[audit-book-2.txt, p.56-57][^6].
- **Other Matter (OM):** Refers to matters not disclosed in the financial statements but relevant to users’ understanding of the audit or auditor’s responsibilities (e.g., prior period audited by another auditor)[audit-book-2.txt, p.57-58][^6].
- **Placement:** EoM and OM paragraphs are placed in the report based on their significance and relationship to other sections[audit-book-2.txt, p.56][^6].

---

### **7. Reporting on Special Purpose Financial Statements (SLAuS 800)

- Special considerations apply when auditing financial statements prepared for specific users or purposes.
- The audit report must describe the purpose and intended users, and include an EoM paragraph alerting users to the special purpose framework[audit-book-2.txt, p.51].

---

### **8. Reporting on Other Information (SLAuS 720)

- The auditor’s report must include a section on “Other Information” when audited financial statements are accompanied by other documents (e.g., annual reports).
- The auditor describes responsibilities regarding this information and reports any material inconsistencies or misstatements[audit-book-2.txt, p.48][^7].

---

### **9. Communication with Those Charged with Governance

- Auditors must communicate expected modifications, EoM, or OM paragraphs with those charged with governance before finalizing the report[audit-book-2.txt, p.69, 72].

---

### **10. Examples of Audit Report Extracts

- **Unmodified Opinion:**
“In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ABC Company as of December 31, 20X1, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.”[audit-book-2.txt, p.46]
- **Qualified Opinion (Material Misstatement):**
“Except for the effects of the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects…”[audit-book-2.txt, p.65]
- **Adverse Opinion:**
“Because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion section, the accompanying financial statements do not present fairly…”[audit-book-2.txt, p.66]
- **Disclaimer of Opinion:**
“We do not express an opinion on the accompanying financial statements… Because of the significance of the matters described in the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion section, we have not been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence…”[audit-book-2.txt, p.68]
- **Emphasis of Matter:**
“We draw attention to Note X of the financial statements, which describes the effects of a fire in the Company’s production facilities. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.”[audit-book-2.txt, p.57]

### **11. Summary and Key Points

- The auditor’s report is the primary means of communicating the audit opinion and significant findings to users.
- Unmodified opinions are issued when financial statements are materially correct; modified opinions are used for material misstatements or limitations.
- Key Audit Matters, Emphasis of Matter, and Other Matter paragraphs provide additional transparency and context.
- Special purpose reports and other information sections address unique reporting circumstances.
- Effective communication with governance and thorough documentation are essential for audit quality and compliance.
