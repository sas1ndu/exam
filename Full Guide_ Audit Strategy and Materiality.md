## Full Guide: Audit Strategy and Materiality

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step explanation of **Audit Strategy and Materiality**, integrating all key concepts, standards, and practical applications from the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, the study text, and authoritative auditing standards.

---

### **1. Introduction**

Audit strategy and materiality are central to effective audit planning and execution. The audit strategy sets the direction, scope, and focus of the audit, while materiality guides auditors in identifying and responding to matters that could influence users’ decisions based on the financial statements[audit-book-2.txt, p.8][^7].

---

### **2. Audit Strategy**

#### **A. Definition and Purpose**

- **Audit strategy** is the high-level approach that outlines how the audit will be conducted, including the scope, timing, and direction of the audit, and guides the development of the detailed audit plan[audit-book-2.txt, p.8][^7].
- It ensures that resources are allocated to areas of higher risk and that the audit is both efficient and effective.


#### **B. Components of Audit Strategy**

- **Understanding the Entity:** Assess the entity’s business, industry, regulatory environment, and internal controls.
- **Identifying Significant Risks:** Focus on areas with higher risk of material misstatement.
- **Setting Materiality:** Establish thresholds for planning and evaluating misstatements.
- **Resource Allocation:** Assign experienced staff to high-risk areas and plan for supervision and review.
- **Engagement Team Selection:** Ensure team members have the necessary expertise, especially for complex or high-risk areas.
- **Budgeting:** Allocate sufficient time and resources for critical audit areas.
- **Professional Skepticism:** Emphasize the need for a questioning mind throughout the audit process.
- **Previous Audit Results:** Consider past audit findings, especially weaknesses in internal control and management’s response[^7].


#### **C. Documentation**

- The overall audit strategy and plan must be documented, including significant decisions, identified risks, and planned responses[audit-book-2.txt, p.8][^7].

---

### **3. Materiality**

#### **A. Definition**

- **Materiality** is information whose omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. It provides a threshold or cut-off point, not a qualitative characteristic required for information to be useful[^3][^6][^4][^5].


#### **B. Role in the Audit**

- Materiality is considered at all stages:
    - **Planning:** Determines the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.
    - **Performing:** Guides the evaluation of identified misstatements and their impact.
    - **Concluding:** Assists in forming an audit opinion on whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement[^3][^6][^4][^5].


#### **C. Determining Materiality**

- **Quantitative Factors:** Usually based on a percentage of a benchmark (e.g., profit before tax, total assets, revenue).
- **Qualitative Factors:** Certain items may be material due to their nature (e.g., related party transactions, compliance with legal requirements), even if the amounts are small[^3][^4][^5].
- **Cumulative Effects:** Small misstatements, when aggregated, may become material[^3][^5].
- **Professional Judgment:** The assessment of materiality is not formulaic; it requires the auditor’s professional judgment in context[^3][^4][^6].


#### **D. Types of Materiality**

- **Overall Materiality:** For the financial statements as a whole.
- **Performance Materiality:** Set at a lower level to reduce the risk that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality[^6].
- **Specific Materiality:** For particular classes of transactions, account balances, or disclosures where lower thresholds are appropriate[^3][^6].


#### **E. Revision During the Audit**

- Materiality may need to be revised as the audit progresses if new information comes to light or if initial assumptions change[^6].

---

### **4. Relationship Between Audit Strategy and Materiality**

- The audit strategy is shaped by the auditor’s determination of materiality, as this influences the focus of audit procedures and the allocation of resources.
- Materiality directly affects the identification of significant risks and the design of audit responses.
- The auditor must reassess materiality if circumstances change during the audit[^3][^6][^7].

---

### **5. Practical Application**

#### **A. Audit Planning**

- Establish acceptable materiality levels for planning purposes.
- Identify material components and account balances.
- Focus on areas where there is a higher risk of material misstatement[^7].


#### **B. Performing Audit Procedures**

- Design procedures to detect misstatements exceeding materiality.
- Consider both the amount and nature of potential misstatements[^3][^4][^5].


#### **C. Evaluating Misstatements**

- Assess the effect of identified misstatements individually and in aggregate.
- Consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects when evaluating their impact on the financial statements[^3][^5][^6].


#### **D. Communication**

- Communicate materiality considerations and significant findings to those charged with governance[^5][^7].

---

### **6. Standards and Guidance**

- **SLAuS 300:** Planning an audit of financial statements, including establishing the audit strategy and plan[^7].
- **SLAuS 320:** Materiality in planning and performing an audit—responsibility to apply materiality throughout the audit process[^6].
- **SLAuS 450:** Evaluating misstatements identified during the audit[^6].
- **International Guidance:** Similar principles are found in ISA 320 and other international standards[^3][^4][^5][^6].

---

### **7. Key Points and Summary**

- The audit strategy sets the overall direction, scope, and focus of the audit.
- Materiality is a critical concept that determines which misstatements are significant enough to influence users’ decisions.
- Both quantitative and qualitative factors must be considered in setting and applying materiality.
- Materiality is integral to audit planning, execution, and forming the audit opinion.
- The auditor’s professional judgment is essential in determining and revising materiality.
- Documentation of the audit strategy and materiality considerations is required[^3][^6][^7][audit-book-2.txt, p.8].

---

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - Audit strategy and materiality are foundational to an effective and efficient audit.
> - Materiality guides the auditor’s focus, procedures, and evaluation of audit findings.
> - Both are dynamic concepts, requiring ongoing judgment and reassessment as the audit progresses.
