Based on the **June 2023 exam paper** ([Paper_June_2023.txt][^6]) and the CA Sri Lanka study text, the following **high concern areas** are identified for your Advanced Audit and Assurance exam preparation. These areas are repeatedly tested, require strong application skills, and are often linked to common mistakes or weaknesses in candidate answers:

---

## 1. **Audit Reporting and Key Audit Matters (KAMs)**

- **Types of Audit Opinions:** Understanding unmodified, qualified, adverse, and disclaimer opinions, and the circumstances requiring each (e.g., material misstatements, inability to obtain sufficient evidence, pervasive effects).
- **KAMs:** Application of SLAuS 701—how to decide what is a KAM, how to describe and communicate KAMs, and their relationship with Emphasis of Matter (EoM) and Other Matter (OM) paragraphs.
- **Reporting on Going Concern:** When to include a material uncertainty, how it affects the audit opinion, and the distinction between KAMs and reporting modifications.
- **Communication with Those Charged with Governance:** Requirement to discuss modifications, EoM, OM, and KAMs before finalizing the report.


## 2. **Audit Evidence and Procedures**

- **Sampling and Sufficiency:** How to select appropriate samples for confirmations (trade debtors, payables), and what factors make a sample sufficient and appropriate.
- **Analytical Procedures:** Designing and evaluating analytical procedures for substantive testing (e.g., revenue completeness), and understanding their limitations.
- **External Confirmations:** When and how to use positive vs. negative confirmations, and the risks of relying solely on confirmations, especially with non-responses or management-imposed limitations.
- **Test of Details and Controls:** Application of CAATs, test data, and the distinction between test of details, analytical procedures, and tests of controls.


## 3. **Digital Environment and IT Controls**

- **IT General Controls:** Identification and explanation of controls to prevent unauthorized changes to computer programs (e.g., access controls, change management).
- **Data Analytics:** How data analytics can be used to audit sales and other transactions, and the benefits/limitations of big data, RPA, and AI.
- **Cybersecurity:** Awareness of cyber risks and controls to mitigate them.


## 4. **Ethics and Independence**

- **Ethical Threats:** Identification and explanation of self-interest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity, and intimidation threats (e.g., prior consultancy, shareholdings).
- **Safeguards:** Appropriate responses to breaches (e.g., removing conflicted staff, communicating with governance).
- **Fundamental Principles:** Application of integrity, objectivity, professional competence, confidentiality, and professional behavior in practical scenarios.


## 5. **Quality Control**

- **System of Quality Controls:** Elements of SLSQC 1 and SLAuS 220, including leadership, ethical requirements, acceptance/continuance, human resources, engagement performance, monitoring, and documentation.
- **Engagement Quality Control Review (EQCR):** When it is required (e.g., high-risk engagements, restatements), and the necessity for completion before audit report issuance.


## 6. **Assurance and Related Services**

- **Engagement Acceptance:** Preconditions for assurance and review engagements (e.g., SLSAE 3400 for prospective financial information).
- **Review Engagements vs. Audits:** Differences in procedures, evidence, and reporting.
- **Agreed-Upon Procedures and Compilation Engagements:** Scope and reporting requirements.


## 7. **Complex and Judgmental Audit Areas**

- **Material Misstatements:** Assessing risks at the assertion level (e.g., inventory, impairment, revenue recognition, provisions).
- **Going Concern Assessment:** Procedures to evaluate management’s assessment, evidence required, and reporting implications.
- **Estimates and Provisions:** Auditing significant estimates (e.g., impairment, ECL models), and evaluating management’s assumptions and disclosures.


## 8. **Internal Audit and Governance**

- **Role and Charter of Internal Audit:** Key elements of an internal audit charter, audit universe, and planning.
- **Audit Committee:** Its role in oversight, independence, and effectiveness of internal audit.

---

### **Examiner Insights and Common Pitfalls**

- **Application over Theory:** Many questions are scenario-based. Marks are awarded for applying knowledge to the facts, not just for listing theory.
- **Justification and Reasoning:** You must explain *why* a risk/procedure/opinion is appropriate, not just state it.
- **Sufficiency of Evidence:** Examiners frequently note that candidates do not justify whether evidence or sample sizes are sufficient.
- **Ethics and Independence:** Candidates often fail to identify all relevant threats and appropriate safeguards in practical scenarios.
- **Digital Auditing:** Increasing focus on data analytics, CAATs, and IT controls—ensure you can discuss both benefits and limitations.

## **Summary Table: High Concern Exam Areas (2023)**

| Area | Key Focus in 2023 Exam |
| :-- | :-- |
| Audit Reporting \& KAMs | Types of opinions, KAMs, EoM/OM, going concern reporting |
| Audit Evidence \& Procedures | Sampling, confirmations, analytical procedures, CAATs |
| Digital Environment \& IT | IT controls, data analytics, cybersecurity |
| Ethics \& Independence | Threats, safeguards, Code of Ethics application |
| Quality Control | SLSQC 1, SLAuS 220, EQCR |
| Assurance \& Related Services | Engagement acceptance, SLSAE 3400, reviews vs. audits |
| Complex/Judgmental Areas | Assertion-level risks, estimates, going concern |
| Internal Audit \& Governance | Audit committee, internal audit charter, oversight |


---

**Recommendation:**
Focus your revision and practice on these high concern areas, using scenario-based questions from recent exams. Practice articulating your reasoning, applying standards to facts, and drafting clear, concise answers. This approach aligns with examiner expectations and the most frequently tested, high-value topics in recent CA Sri Lanka audit exams[^6][^1].
