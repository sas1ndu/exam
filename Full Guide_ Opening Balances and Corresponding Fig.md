## Full Guide: Opening Balances and Corresponding Figures

This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of the auditor’s responsibilities and procedures relating to **opening balances** and **corresponding figures**, drawing from Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS 510 \& 710), the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, and best audit practices.

---

### **1. Introduction**

**Opening balances** are those account balances that exist at the beginning of the period, based on the closing balances of the prior period. They also include matters requiring disclosure at the beginning of the period, such as contingencies and commitments. **Corresponding figures** (comparative information) are prior period figures presented in the current period’s financial statements for comparison purposes[^3][^4][^5].

Auditors must obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding opening balances and ensure that corresponding figures are properly presented and disclosed.

---

### **2. Opening Balances: Auditor’s Responsibilities (SLAuS 510)**

#### **A. Scope**

SLAuS 510 applies to initial audit engagements, including when:

- The prior period’s financial statements were not audited, or
- The prior period’s financial statements were audited by a predecessor auditor[^3][^5][^6].


#### **B. Objectives**

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about whether:
    - Opening balances contain misstatements that materially affect the current period’s financial statements.
    - Appropriate accounting policies reflected in opening balances have been consistently applied, or changes are properly accounted for and disclosed[^3][^5].


#### **C. Key Definitions**

- **Initial Audit Engagement:** First-time audit or when the prior period was audited by a different auditor.
- **Opening Balances:** Balances at the start of the period, including effects of prior transactions and policies.
- **Predecessor Auditor:** Auditor from a different firm who audited the previous period[^3][^5].

---

### **3. Audit Procedures for Opening Balances**

#### **A. Obtain and Review Prior Information**

- Read the most recent financial statements and the predecessor auditor’s report for information relevant to opening balances, including disclosures[^3][^5].


#### **B. Obtain Sufficient Appropriate Audit Evidence**

1. **Check Carry-Forward of Balances**
    - Determine if prior period’s closing balances are correctly brought forward or restated as needed.
2. **Evaluate Consistency of Accounting Policies**
    - Verify that accounting policies are consistently applied or changes are properly accounted for and disclosed.
3. **Perform Audit Procedures**
    - Review predecessor auditor’s working papers (if available and prior year was audited).
    - Evaluate whether current period audit procedures provide evidence about opening balances.
    - Perform specific audit procedures as necessary (e.g., examine records, obtain third-party confirmations for noncurrent assets and liabilities)[^3][^5][^6].

#### **C. Addressing Misstatements**

- If misstatements in opening balances could materially affect the current period, perform additional procedures to determine their effect.
- Communicate any misstatements with management and those charged with governance[^3][^5].


#### **D. Consistency of Accounting Policies**

- Ensure policies reflected in opening balances are consistently applied.
- For changes, verify proper accounting, presentation, and disclosure[^3][^5].


#### **E. Dealing with Modifications in the Predecessor Auditor’s Report**

- If the prior period’s report was modified, evaluate the impact on current period risk assessment and audit procedures[^3][^5].

---

### **4. Audit Conclusions and Reporting (SLAuS 510)**

#### **A. Inability to Obtain Sufficient Evidence**

- If unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about opening balances, express a **qualified opinion** or **disclaim an opinion** as appropriate[^3][^5].


#### **B. Misstatements in Opening Balances**

- If opening balances contain misstatements that materially affect the current period and are not properly accounted for or disclosed, express a **qualified opinion** or **adverse opinion**[^3][^5].


#### **C. Inconsistent Accounting Policies**

- If accounting policies are not applied consistently and changes are not properly accounted for or disclosed, express a **qualified** or **adverse opinion**[^3][^5].


#### **D. Effect of Prior Period Modifications**

- If a prior period modification remains relevant and material to the current period, consider its effect on the current audit opinion[^3][^5].

---

### **5. Corresponding Figures and Comparative Information (SLAuS 710)**

#### **A. Scope**

- SLAuS 710 deals with the auditor’s responsibilities for comparative information, including corresponding figures and comparative financial statements[^4].


#### **B. Nature of Comparative Information**

- **Corresponding Figures:** Prior period figures presented for comparison; auditor’s opinion refers only to the current period (the approach in Sri Lanka).
- **Comparative Financial Statements:** Auditor’s opinion refers to each period presented (not the standard approach in Sri Lanka)[^4].


#### **C. Auditor’s Objectives**

- Obtain sufficient appropriate evidence that:
    - Comparative information is appropriately presented and disclosed.
    - The prior period’s audit opinion (if applicable) is considered in the current audit[^4].


#### **D. Procedures**

- Evaluate whether comparative information agrees with the amounts and disclosures presented in the prior period.
- Determine whether accounting policies are consistently applied.
- If the prior period was audited by another auditor, refer to their report as appropriate (may include an “Other Matter” paragraph)[^4].


#### **E. Reporting**

- For corresponding figures, the auditor’s opinion covers only the current period.
- If a material misstatement or inability to obtain sufficient evidence relates to the comparative information, modify the opinion or include an “Other Matter” paragraph as needed[^4].

---

### **6. Practical Considerations and Examples**

- **Initial Engagements:** Extra care is needed as the auditor may not have prior knowledge or evidence.
- **Reviewing Predecessor’s Work:** Assess competence and independence before relying on prior auditor’s work.
- **Noncurrent Assets/Liabilities:** May require third-party confirmations or additional procedures for opening balances[^5][^6].
- **Reporting Examples:** If unable to observe prior inventory count, and alternative procedures are insufficient, qualify the opinion with a clear explanation[^5].

---

### **7. Summary and Key Points**

- Opening balances and corresponding figures are critical for audit quality and comparability.
- Auditors must ensure opening balances are free from material misstatement and that accounting policies are consistently applied.
- Sufficient appropriate evidence must be obtained, including reviewing predecessor auditor’s work and performing specific procedures as needed.
- Inability to obtain evidence or unresolved misstatements may require a qualified, adverse, or disclaimer of opinion.
- For corresponding figures, the auditor’s opinion generally covers only the current period, but prior period issues may require disclosure or modification[^3][^4][^5][^6].

---

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - SLAuS 510 and 710 set out clear requirements for opening balances and comparative information.
> - Audit procedures must be robust, especially in initial engagements or when prior period issues exist.
> - Reporting must transparently communicate any limitations or misstatements affecting opening balances or comparatives.
