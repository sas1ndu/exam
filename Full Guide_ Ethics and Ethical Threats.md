## Full Guide: Ethics and Ethical Threats

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of **Ethics and Ethical Threats** for professional accountants, integrating the CA Sri Lanka Code of Ethics, international best practices, and the CA Sri Lanka curriculum[audit-book-2.txt, p.575][^6][^7][^8][^9].

---

### **1. Introduction to Ethics in the Accounting Profession

Ethics are fundamental to the role of accountants and auditors. The **Code of Ethics** sets out the principles and values that guide professional behavior, ensuring public trust, integrity, and credibility in financial reporting and assurance services. CA Sri Lanka’s Code of Ethics, aligned with IFAC’s international standards, is mandatory for all members and is central to both professional and business conduct[^6][^7][^8][^9].

---

### **2. Fundamental Principles of Professional Ethics

The Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants prescribes five fundamental principles[^6][^7][^8][^9]:


| Principle | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Integrity** | Be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships. |
| **Objectivity** | Do not allow bias, conflicts of interest, or undue influence to override professional judgment. |
| **Professional Competence \& Due Care** | Maintain professional knowledge and skill at a level required to ensure competent service, and act diligently. |
| **Confidentiality** | Respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of professional and business relationships. Do not disclose or use such information without authority. |
| **Professional Behavior** | Comply with relevant laws and regulations and avoid any action that discredits the profession. |

These principles underpin all ethical guidance and are expected to be upheld at all times[^6][^7][^8][^9].

---

### **3. Conceptual Framework Approach

The Code adopts a **conceptual framework** to identify, evaluate, and address threats to compliance with the fundamental principles[^6][^7][^8][^9][^5]:

1. **Identify threats** to compliance with the principles.
2. **Evaluate the significance** of the threats.
3. **Address the threats** by eliminating them or reducing them to an acceptable level using safeguards.

If threats cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, the professional accountant must decline or end the engagement[^5][^6][^7].

---

### **4. Types of Ethical Threats

The main categories of threats to ethical compliance are[^6][^7][^5][^4]:


| Threat Type | Description | Example |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Self-interest** | Financial or other interests inappropriately influence judgment or behavior. | Owning shares in a client company. |
| **Self-review** | Reviewing one’s own work or judgments made previously. | Auditing financial statements that the auditor previously prepared. |
| **Advocacy** | Promoting a client’s or employer’s position to the point that objectivity is compromised. | Representing a client in a legal dispute. |
| **Familiarity** | Becoming too sympathetic to the interests of others due to a close or long-term relationship. | Auditing a long-standing client or close friend. |
| **Intimidation** | Being deterred from acting objectively due to actual or perceived pressures. | Directors threaten to replace the auditor if an unqualified opinion is not given. |

Each threat may arise from personal, professional, or business relationships, including those involving family or close associates[^4][^5][^7].

---

### **5. Safeguards Against Ethical Threats

**Safeguards** are actions or measures that eliminate or reduce threats to an acceptable level[^5][^6][^7]:

- **Eliminate the circumstances** creating the threat (e.g., dispose of a financial interest).
- **Apply safeguards** (e.g., independent reviews, rotation of personnel, enhanced supervision).
- **Decline or end the engagement** if threats cannot be reduced to an acceptable level.

Safeguards may be:

- Created by the profession, legislation, or regulation (e.g., mandatory rotation, external reviews).
- Established within the work environment (e.g., internal controls, clear reporting lines, whistleblowing policies).

Ultimately, ethical conduct is a personal responsibility[^5][^6][^7].

---

### **6. Independence and Non-Assurance Services

**Independence** is a cornerstone of audit and assurance. Accountants must be independent in both mind and appearance. Providing non-assurance services (e.g., consulting, management functions) to audit clients can create threats, especially self-review and advocacy threats[^6][^7][^8][^9].

- Firms should not assume management responsibilities for audit clients.
- Safeguards include separating audit and non-audit teams, obtaining client approval for non-audit work, and disclosing services provided.

---

### **7. Ethical Conflict Resolution

When faced with an ethical dilemma, accountants should[^6][^7][^4][^5]:

1. **Gather all relevant facts** and identify the ethical issues.
2. **Consider the fundamental principles** and the conceptual framework.
3. **Evaluate the significance of threats** and possible safeguards.
4. **Consult with appropriate persons or bodies** (e.g., ethics committee, legal counsel).
5. **Document the decision-making process** and rationale.
6. **Take appropriate action**—which may include declining or withdrawing from the engagement.

The “reasonable and informed third party test” is often applied: Would another impartial, knowledgeable person reach the same conclusion in the circumstances?[^5][^7].

---

### **8. Confidentiality

Accountants must not disclose confidential information acquired in the course of professional work without proper authority, unless there is a legal or professional right or duty to disclose[^6][^7][^4]. Disclosure may be required by law, to protect the public interest, or with client consent.

---

### **9. Ethics in Corporate Governance and Sustainability

Ethics underpin good corporate governance and the credibility of financial reporting[^3][^9]. Accountants are gatekeepers of public trust and play a vital role in upholding integrity in both private and public sectors. Ethical responsibilities also extend to supporting sustainability and responsible business practices[^4][^9].

---

### **10. Enforcement and Disciplinary Action

Failure to comply with the Code of Ethics may result in disciplinary action by the CA Sri Lanka Ethics Committee, including investigation, sanctions, or removal from membership[^6][^8][^9].

---

### **11. Summary and Key Points
