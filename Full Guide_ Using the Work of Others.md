## Full Guide: Using the Work of Others

This guide comprehensively covers the lesson **Using the Work of Others** in the context of an audit, synthesizing all relevant concepts, standards, and practical applications as outlined in the CA Sri Lanka curriculum, study text, and Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS).

---

### **1. Introduction**

In modern audits, external auditors often consider the work performed by other professionals to enhance audit efficiency and effectiveness. This includes:

- Internal auditors
- Management’s or auditor’s experts
- Auditors of service organizations

Using the work of others does not reduce the external auditor’s responsibility for the audit opinion but can inform the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures[audit-book-2.txt, p.9][^4].

---

### **2. Internal Auditors (SLAuS 610)**

#### **A. Relationship and Scope**

- Internal audit is an appraisal activity within the entity, examining and evaluating internal controls.
- The external auditor may use the work of internal auditors if their function is relevant to the audit and meets certain quality criteria[^4].


#### **B. Determining Whether to Use Internal Audit Work**

The external auditor must evaluate:

- **Objectivity** of the internal audit function (independence from management, reporting lines)
- **Technical competence** of internal auditors (qualifications, experience)
- **Due professional care** in the work performed (quality of documentation, supervision, and review)
- **Effective communication** between internal and external auditors[^4].


#### **C. Extent of Reliance**

- The auditor considers the nature and scope of the internal auditors’ work, the assessed risks of material misstatement, and the degree of subjectivity in audit evidence.
- Higher risk or more subjective areas require less reliance on internal audit work[^4].


#### **D. Using Specific Work**

If the auditor decides to use specific work of internal auditors, they must:

- Evaluate whether the work was performed by competent staff, was properly supervised and reviewed, and is adequately documented.
- Ensure that conclusions are appropriate and exceptions are resolved.
- Perform audit procedures to determine if the work is adequate for external audit purposes[^4].


#### **E. Documentation**

- The external auditor must document conclusions regarding the adequacy of internal audit work and the procedures performed to evaluate it[^4].

---

### **3. Management’s and Auditor’s Experts (SLAuS 620)**

#### **A. When Experts Are Used**

- Experts are engaged when specialized knowledge is required (e.g., valuing complex financial instruments, actuarial calculations, legal opinions).
- Experts may be engaged by management (management’s expert) or by the auditor (auditor’s expert)[audit-book-2.txt, p.9].


#### **B. Evaluating the Work of Experts**

The auditor must:

- Assess the competence, capabilities, and objectivity of the expert.
- Obtain an understanding of the expert’s work and evaluate its relevance and reasonableness.
- Consider the expert’s methodology, assumptions, and source data.


#### **C. Using the Work of Experts**

- The auditor remains responsible for the audit opinion and must not simply accept the expert’s findings without critical evaluation.
- If the expert’s work is used as audit evidence, the auditor must ensure it is sufficient and appropriate for the audit purpose.

---

### **4. Service Organization Auditors (SLAuS 402)**

#### **A. Relevance**

- Some entities use service organizations (e.g., payroll processors, IT service providers) that process transactions or maintain records relevant to the financial statements.


#### **B. Evaluating Controls at Service Organizations**

- The auditor must understand the nature and significance of services provided and assess the effect on the entity’s internal controls.
- If necessary, the auditor may use reports from service organization auditors (e.g., SOC 1 reports) to obtain evidence about controls at the service organization[audit-book-2.txt, p.9].


#### **C. Reliance and Limitations**

- The auditor must evaluate the competence and independence of the service organization auditor and the sufficiency of evidence provided.
- The external auditor remains responsible for the audit opinion.

---

### **5. Impact of Digitization and Automation**

- Digitization is transforming internal audit, requiring auditors to be tech-savvy and use data analytics and automation tools (e.g., Power BI, Alteryx) for more efficient and effective audits[^5].
- Data analytics can be used at all audit stages, from planning to reporting, allowing for continuous risk-based decisions and deeper insights.
- The scope of internal and external audit is expanding to cover advanced technological processes, including cybersecurity and artificial intelligence[^5].

---

### **6. Key Points and Practical Considerations**

- **Professional Judgement:** The external auditor must always exercise professional judgement when relying on the work of others.
- **Responsibility:** The external auditor retains sole responsibility for the audit opinion, regardless of reliance on others.
- **Communication:** Effective communication between internal and external auditors and with experts is essential.
- **Documentation:** All decisions and evaluations regarding the use of others’ work must be thoroughly documented for audit quality and compliance.

---

### **7. Summary**

- Using the work of others can enhance audit efficiency, but it requires careful evaluation of objectivity, competence, and quality.
- Reliance is always limited by the risk and subjectivity of the area under audit.
- The external auditor must remain skeptical, perform necessary procedures, and document all conclusions.
- Digitization is increasing the value and complexity of both internal and external audit functions, emphasizing the need for continuous learning and adaptation[^5].

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - Use of internal auditors, experts, and service organization auditors is governed by SLAuS 610, 620, and 402.
> - The external auditor’s responsibility for the audit opinion is not reduced by reliance on others.
> - Effective use of others’ work requires rigorous evaluation, communication, and documentation.
> - Digitization and automation are reshaping audit collaboration and reliance on the work of others.
