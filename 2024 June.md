# these kind of questions ask in exam and for that answers also i uplorded in txt file (Answer_June_2024 and Paper_June_2024txt files) based on that give me the high concern areas

Based on the **June 2024 exam papers, suggested answers, examiner comments, and the CA Sri Lanka study text**, the following **high concern areas** consistently emerge as critical for exam success in Advanced Audit and Assurance. These areas are frequently tested, require sound application and reasoning (not just rote learning), and are often cited as weaknesses in candidate performance:

---

## 1. **Complex and Judgmental Audit Areas**

- **Goodwill, Impairment, and Fair Value:** Auditing goodwill, investment property, and other assets requiring estimation and judgment is a high-risk area. Candidates must explain *why* these are risk areas (e.g., due to estimation uncertainty, management bias) and design audit procedures accordingly[^6].
- **Deferred Tax and Financial Instruments:** Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities, and valuation of complex financial instruments, require special attention to judgment, estimation, and compliance with SLFRS[^6].


## 2. **Group Audits and Component Auditors**

- **Consolidation Adjustments:** Special attention is needed for group audits where subsidiaries have different reporting dates or use different financial reporting frameworks. Candidates must address consolidation, elimination of intercompany transactions, and translation of foreign operations[^6].
- **Communication with Component Auditors:** The group auditor must communicate risks such as related party transactions, impairment methodologies, and fair value assessments to component auditors[^6].


## 3. **Related Party Transactions and Disclosures**

- **Identification and Audit Procedures:** Related party relationships and transactions must be thoroughly identified, tested for arm’s length, and properly disclosed. This is a recurring exam topic due to the risk of non-disclosure or misstatement[^6].


## 4. **Going Concern and Support Letters**

- **Assessment and Evidence:** Evaluating going concern, especially for subsidiaries with financial difficulties, is critical. Candidates should know how to assess management’s plans, obtain support letters, and determine their adequacy[^6].


## 5. **Audit Evidence and Special Areas**

- **Gathering Sufficient Evidence:** Procedures for key balances (e.g., investments, inventory, litigation) must be robust. This includes reconciling to external sources, reviewing board minutes, and confirming with third parties[^6].
- **Audit Procedures for Special Areas:** Candidates must demonstrate knowledge of procedures for inventory counts, segment information, and litigation—areas where examiners note frequent errors or omissions[^6].


## 6. **Audit Reporting and Key Audit Matters (KAMs)**

- **Modified Opinions:** Understanding when to issue qualified, adverse, or disclaimer opinions, and the basis for each, is essential. Candidates should be able to draft appropriate report extracts[^6][audit-book-2.txt, p.43-66].
- **KAMs, Emphasis of Matter, and Other Matter Paragraphs:** Clear articulation of what constitutes a KAM, when to use EoM/OM paragraphs, and how these interact with the audit opinion is a frequent exam focus[^6][audit-book-2.txt, p.52-58].


## 7. **Ethics and Auditor Independence**

- **Ethical Threats and Safeguards:** Self-interest, self-review, advocacy, familiarity, and intimidation threats must be identified and addressed with appropriate safeguards. Non-assurance services and overdue fees are common scenarios[^6][audit-book-2.txt, p.168-188].
- **Application of the Conceptual Framework:** Candidates must apply the Code of Ethics to practical scenarios, not just recite principles.


## 8. **Digital Environment and Audit Automation**

- **Use of CAATs and Data Analytics:** Understanding the benefits, limitations, and application of audit software, test data, and data analytics is increasingly tested. Cybersecurity controls and audit automation are also high-priority areas[audit-book-2.txt, p.21-37].


## 9. **Assurance and Related Services**

- **Distinguishing Engagement Types:** Candidates must clearly differentiate between audits, reviews, agreed-upon procedures, and compilations, and know the reporting requirements for each[audit-book-2.txt, p.495].
- **Application of SLSAE 3000, SLSRE 2400/2410, SLSRS 4400/4410:** Understanding the scope, evidence, and reporting for each engagement type is essential.


## 10. **Quality Control**

- **Firm and Engagement Level Controls:** Elements of SLSQC 1 and SLAuS 220, including leadership, acceptance/continuance, human resources, engagement performance, and monitoring, are frequently tested[audit-book-2.txt, p.551].

---

### **Examiner Insights and Common Pitfalls**

- **Reasoning and Application:** Examiners note that many candidates identify risk areas but fail to explain *why* they are risks or how to address them[^6].
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Expect application to real-world scenarios—rote learning is insufficient.
- **Communication and Documentation:** Ability to draft clear, concise audit documentation and reports is essential.
- **Current Issues:** Be prepared for questions on digital auditing, data analytics, and emerging risks.

**Focus your revision and practice on these high concern areas, ensuring you can both identify issues and explain your reasoning and procedures in detail.** This approach aligns with examiner expectations and the most frequently tested, high-value topics in recent CA Sri Lanka audit exams[^6][audit-book-2.txt, p.7-15, 43-66, 168-188].
