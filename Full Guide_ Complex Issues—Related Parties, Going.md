## Full Guide: Complex Issues—Related Parties, Going Concern, Accounting Estimates

This guide synthesizes key concepts, auditing standards (SLAuS 540, 550, 570), and practical applications for addressing **related party transactions**, **going concern**, and **accounting estimates** in an audit, as outlined in the CA Sri Lanka curriculum and study materials.

---

### **1. Related Party Transactions (SLAuS 550)**

#### **A. Definition and Risks**

- **Related parties**: Entities/persons with control, joint control, or significant influence over the entity, or close family members of management.
- **Risks**: Undisclosed transactions, biased terms, misstatements due to improper valuation/disclosure, or fraud.


#### **B. Auditor’s Responsibilities**

1. **Identify Related Parties**:
    - Review prior audits, minutes, contracts, and regulatory filings.
    - Inquire of management and those charged with governance about relationships.
2. **Assess Risks**:
    - Evaluate whether transactions are at arm’s length.
    - Identify significant related party transactions (SRPTs) outside normal business operations.
3. **Perform Substantive Procedures**:
    - Confirm terms with third parties (e.g., banks, legal advisors).
    - Verify approvals by those charged with governance.
    - Recalculate valuations and assess compliance with SLFRS 24 *Related Party Disclosures*.
4. **Evaluate Disclosures**:
    - Ensure nature, terms, and amounts of transactions are fully disclosed.

#### **C. Red Flags and Responses**

- **Unusual transactions**: Prices deviating from market rates, complex contractual terms.
- **Mitigation**: Enhanced scrutiny, external confirmations, and evaluating management’s rationale.

**Example**:
A company sells property to a director’s relative below market value. The auditor reviews independent valuations, confirms board approval, and ensures disclosure in notes.

---

### **2. Going Concern (SLAuS 570)**

#### **A. Key Concepts**

- **Going concern assumption**: Entity will continue operating for the foreseeable future (at least 12 months post-reporting date).
- **Material uncertainty**: Events/conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue.


#### **B. Auditor’s Responsibilities**

1. **Evaluate Management’s Assessment**:
    - Review cash flow forecasts, debt repayment schedules, and contingency plans.
    - Assess adequacy of supporting evidence (e.g., loan renewal commitments).
2. **Identify Events/Conditions**:
    - Financial: Recurring losses, loan defaults, working capital deficiencies.
    - Operational: Loss of key customers, regulatory bans.
    - External: Economic downturns, industry crises.
3. **Additional Procedures if Risks Identified**:
    - Analyze post-period-end events (e.g., post-balance sheet financing).
    - Request written representations from management about plans.
4. **Reporting Implications**:
    - **Unmodified opinion with EoM**: If disclosures are adequate but material uncertainty exists.
    - **Adverse opinion**: If disclosures are inadequate or management refuses to extend assessment.

**Case Study**:
A manufacturing firm faces liquidity issues due to delayed customer payments. The auditor reviews revised budgets, confirms lender commitments, and assesses the feasibility of asset sales. If disclosures are insufficient, a modified opinion is issued.

### **3. Accounting Estimates (SLAuS 540)**

#### **A. Types of Estimates**

- **Fair value measurements**: Impairment of assets, derivative valuations.
- **Provisions**: Warranty liabilities, legal disputes.
- **Other**: Depreciation methods, inventory obsolescence.


#### **B. Auditor’s Approach**

1. **Understand Management’s Process**:
    - Evaluate data sources, assumptions (e.g., discount rates), and approval controls.
2. **Assess Estimation Uncertainty**:
    - Identify high-risk estimates (e.g., subjective assumptions in goodwill impairment).
3. **Test Reasonableness**:
    - Compare prior estimates to actual outcomes.
    - Use auditor’s specialists (e.g., actuaries for pension liabilities).
    - Perform sensitivity analysis on key assumptions.
4. **Evaluate Disclosures**:
    - Ensure transparency about estimation uncertainty and methodology.

#### **C. Indicators of Management Bias**

- Consistent adjustments to achieve targets.
- Overly optimistic growth rates in revenue forecasts.
- Selective use of favorable data.

**Example**:
A real estate company overvalues investment properties using unsupported market growth rates. The auditor engages a valuation expert, compares to independent appraisals, and challenges management’s assumptions.

### **4. Integration of Complex Issues in Audit**

| **Issue** | **Audit Procedures** | **Reporting Impact** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Related Parties** | Confirm transactions with third parties, assess board approvals, review disclosures. | Qualified/adverse opinion if transactions are undisclosed or misstated. |
| **Going Concern** | Analyze cash flows, post-period events, and management’s plans. | Emphasis of Matter paragraph for material uncertainty; adverse opinion if inadequate disclosures. |
| **Estimates** | Test assumptions, involve specialists, compare to industry benchmarks. | Qualified opinion if estimates are unreasonable; disclosure of estimation uncertainty. |


---

### **5. Practical Challenges and Solutions**

- **Data Analytics**: Use tools to identify unusual related party transactions (e.g., repeated payments to obscure entities).
- **Professional Skepticism**: Challenge management’s optimistic scenarios for going concern assessments.
- **Documentation**: Record rationale for accepting/rejecting management’s estimates and key audit judgments.

---

### **6. Summary and Key Points**

- **Related Parties**: Focus on identification, arm’s length terms, and transparency in disclosures.
- **Going Concern**: Link financial/operational indicators to viability, and ensure robust disclosures.
- **Estimates**: Scrutinize assumptions, use experts, and highlight uncertainties.
- **Standards**: SLAuS 540, 550, and 570 provide frameworks for risk assessment and response.

> **Chapter Roundup**
> - Complex issues require tailored audit procedures and heightened professional skepticism.
> - Effective communication with governance and thorough documentation are critical.
> - Digital tools enhance testing but cannot replace auditor judgment.
