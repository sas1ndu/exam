## 2. High Marks Allocated Areas

- **Audit Reporting (including KAMs, modifications, EoM/OM):** Often 20+ marks per paper, especially in scenario-based questions.
- **Audit Evidence \& Procedures (sampling, confirmations, analytical procedures):** Frequently 10–20 marks, including practical scenarios.
- **Digital Environment \& IT Controls:** 10–15 marks, with focus on application and explanation.
- **Ethics \& Independence:** 10–15 marks, often scenario-based.
- **Quality Control:** 10–15 marks, including EQCR and firm-level controls.
- **Complex/Judgmental Areas (e.g., impairment, going concern):** 10–15 marks, requiring application and justification.
- **Assurance \& Related Services:** 10–12 marks, especially on engagement acceptance and reporting.

## 3. Where You Should Focus

### **A. Scenario-Based Application**

- Most high-mark questions require applying knowledge to a given scenario, not just listing theory.
- Practice articulating *why* a risk/procedure/opinion is appropriate.


### **B. Justification and Reasoning**

- Marks are awarded for explaining reasoning, not just identifying issues.
- Always justify sample selection, sufficiency of evidence, and audit responses.


### **C. Ethics and Independence**

- Be able to identify all relevant threats and safeguards in practical scenarios.
- Apply the conceptual framework, not just recite principles.


### **D. Digital Auditing**

- Understand benefits and limitations of CAATs, data analytics, and IT controls.
- Be able to discuss cybersecurity risks and controls.


### **E. Reporting and Communication**

- Draft clear, concise extracts of audit reports, including KAMs, EoM, OM, and modified opinions.
- Know the communication requirements with governance.

## 5. Exam Technique Tips

- **Practice past paper scenarios**—write full answers, not just bullet points.
- **Use action verbs** (explain, assess, justify, evaluate) as per syllabus requirements.
- **Structure answers**: Identify the issue, explain why it’s important, describe the procedure or response, and conclude.
- **Stay updated** on current developments in digital auditing and regulatory changes.
- **Review examiner reports** for common pitfalls and high-performing answer characteristics.
